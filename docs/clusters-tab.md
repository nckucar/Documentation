### What a Cluster is [[top]] {: #what-a-cluster-is data-toc-label='What a Cluster is'}
A Cluster allows connecting multiple machines rendering the same simulation, but different sensors on each machine, this allows to run multiple sensors with better performance. Master establishes a connection with each defined client, divides required sensors between every machine and sends the state of every Simulation element to connected clients synchronizing the environment.

For more details about the cluster, simulations refer to the [Cluster Simulation Introduction](cluster-simulation-introduction.md).
